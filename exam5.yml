    C: 'Drift alone can produce this change, especially in small populations'
    D: 'Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium prevents p from changing'

    B: 'Allele frequency of one allele reaches 1.0 and the other allele is lost'
    C: 'A population becomes polymorphic'

    C: 'Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium forces divergence'

    C: 'Perfect Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium every generation'

- type: MultiChoice
  text: 'Which statement is most consistent with the claim that drift is a major driver of genetic-level evolution?'
  choices:
    A: 'Most molecular variation is neutral or nearly neutral, so sampling can dominate frequency change'

    C: 'Selection is always weaker on islands'

    C: 'Drift strength increases as Ne decreases'

  text: 'The probability of fixation for a neutral allele is independent of its current frequency.'

  text: 'Explain why drift tends to reduce heterozygosity over time in small populations.'
