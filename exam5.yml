- type: MultiChoice
  text: "What did Friedrich Miescher actually isolate in the 1860s when he worked with cell nuclei?"
  choices:
    A: "Proteins that carry genetic information"
    B: "A phosphorus-rich substance he called nuclein (DNA)"
    C: "Pure RNA from cytoplasm"
    D: "Lipids from cell membranes"
  answer: B
  explain: "Miescher isolated a novel, phosphorus-rich material from nuclei he named 'nuclein', which we now recognize as DNA, laying the groundwork for later discoveries."
- type: TrueFalse
  text: "At the time of Miescher’s work, scientists immediately recognized DNA as the genetic material."
  answer: false
  explain: "DNA was known to exist, but it was not recognized as the genetic material until much later experiments (Griffith, Avery et al., Hershey–Chase) showed its role."
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "Why was Miescher’s isolation of nuclein important for modern genetics, even though he did not know its function?"
  answer: "He identified a distinct nuclear substance (DNA), giving later researchers a specific molecule to study as a possible carrier of genetic information."
  explain: "By discovering nuclein as a new chemical component of nuclei, Miescher provided the physical basis that later experiments linked to heredity."

# FP2: Griffith’s transformation and virulent vs non-virulent strains
- type: MultiChoice
  text: "In Griffith’s experiment, what happened when live non-virulent bacteria were mixed with heat-killed virulent bacteria and injected into mice?"
  choices:
    A: "The mice lived and only non-virulent bacteria were recovered"
    B: "The mice died and live virulent bacteria were recovered"
    C: "Nothing grew in the mice at all"
    D: "Only heat-killed bacteria were found in the mice"
  answer: B
  explain: "The harmless bacteria were 'transformed' by material from the dead virulent cells, becoming virulent themselves and killing the mice."
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "Griffith described a mysterious 'transforming principle.' What did this term refer to in his experiment?"
  answer: "Some material released from heat-killed virulent bacteria that could convert non-virulent bacteria into virulent forms."
  explain: "Griffith did not know the chemical identity, but he recognized that something from dead virulent cells permanently changed the traits of live non-virulent cells."
- type: TrueFalse
  text: "Griffith’s experiment showed that the ability to cause disease can be transferred between bacteria by a stable heritable factor."
  answer: true
  explain: "Because non-virulent bacteria became virulent and passed this trait on, his work implied a heritable 'transforming principle' existed."

# FP3: Avery, MacLeod, McCarty — identifying DNA as the transforming principle
- type: MultiChoice
  text: "What was the key finding of Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty’s follow-up work on Griffith’s transformation?"
  choices:
    A: "Proteins are the transforming principle"
    B: "RNA is the transforming principle"
    C: "Lipids are the transforming principle"
    D: "DNA is the transforming principle"
  answer: D
  explain: "When DNA was destroyed by DNase, transformation did not occur, showing that DNA carries the information needed to transform cells."
- type: Matching
  text: "Match each enzyme used by Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty to the macromolecule it digests."
  pairs:
    "1": "Protease"
    "2": "RNase"
    "3": "DNase"
  options:
    A: "RNA"
    B: "DNA"
    C: "Protein"
  answer: {"1":"C","2":"A","3":"B"}
  explain: "Protease removes proteins, RNase removes RNA, and DNase removes DNA; only destroying DNA eliminated transformation, implicating DNA."
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "Why did the absence of transformation in DNase-treated samples convince scientists that DNA was the genetic material?"
  answer: "Because only when DNA was degraded did the transforming ability disappear, indicating that DNA must carry the necessary genetic instructions."
  explain: "If protein or RNA were responsible, destroying them would have blocked transformation, but only DNase treatment had that effect."

# FP4: Bacterial transformation and biotechnology (insulin & vaccines)
- type: MultiChoice
  text: "Which statement best describes how transformation is used to produce human insulin in bacteria?"
  choices:
    A: "Bacteria are fed insulin protein directly so they learn to make it"
    B: "Human insulin DNA is inserted into bacteria, which then express the insulin protein"
    C: "Bacteria naturally make human insulin without any genetic changes"
    D: "Insulin is produced by cows, not bacteria"
  answer: B
  explain: "The human insulin gene is transformed into bacteria; the bacteria read this human DNA and synthesize human insulin protein."
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "Before recombinant DNA technology, where was insulin commonly obtained for diabetics?"
  answer: "From pig and cow pancreases harvested at slaughterhouses."
  explain: "Animal insulin was used but was expensive and supply-limited; transformation of bacteria made production cheaper and more scalable."
- type: TrueFalse
  text: "Some components for modern vaccines and biologics are made using the same basic transformation technology used to make insulin."
  answer: true
  explain: "The same principles—putting human or viral genes into microbes or cells to mass-produce proteins—underlie production of many biologic medicines and vaccine components."

# FP5: Hershey–Chase experiment with bacteriophages
- type: MultiChoice
  text: "What organisms did Hershey and Chase use to prove that DNA is the genetic material?"

    B: "Fruit flies and fungi"
    C: "Bacteriophages and E. coli bacteria"
    D: "Plants and plant viruses"
  answer: C
  explain: "They infected E. coli with bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) and traced whether DNA or protein entered the cells."
- type: MultiChoice
  text: "Why did Hershey and Chase use radioactive phosphorus (³²P) to label DNA and radioactive sulfur (³⁵S) to label protein?"
  choices:
    A: "Phosphorus is only found in proteins, sulfur only in DNA"
    B: "Both isotopes label both DNA and proteins equally"
    C: "Phosphorus is abundant in DNA but not in amino acids; sulfur is abundant in certain amino acids but absent from DNA"
    D: "It was a random choice; the isotopes have no chemical specificity"
  answer: C
  explain: "DNA’s backbone contains phosphate, so ³²P labels DNA; proteins often contain sulfur-containing amino acids, so ³⁵S labels proteins."
- type: TrueFalse
  text: "In the Hershey–Chase experiment, radioactive DNA entered the bacteria while radioactive protein mostly remained outside, indicating DNA carried the genetic information."
  answer: true
  explain: "New phages contained ³²P but not ³⁵S, showing that the material entering the cell and directing phage production was DNA."

# FP6: Chargaff’s rule and base composition
- type: MultiChoice
  text: "Chargaff’s rule states that in double-stranded DNA:"
  choices:
    A: "%A = %G and %C = %T"
    B: "%A = %T and %G = %C"
    C: "All four bases occur in equal amounts"
    D: "%A + %T = 25% of bases"
  answer: B
  explain: "Chargaff found consistent pairing relationships: adenine equals thymine and guanine equals cytosine in double-stranded DNA."
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "If a plant species has 20% adenine in its DNA, what percentage of its bases must be cytosine?"
  answer: "30% cytosine."
  explain: "If A = 20%, then T = 20% (A = T), so A + T = 40%. The remaining 60% must be G + C, and since G = C, each is 30%."
- type: TrueFalse
  text: "Chargaff’s work showed that the overall ratio of A, T, G, and C can vary between species, but A = T and G = C always hold in double-stranded DNA."
  answer: true
  explain: "Species differ in GC content, but the base-pairing relationships A = T and G = C are consistent with double-helix structure."

# FP7: Nucleotide structure, sugars, and bases

  pairs:
    "1": "DNA"
    "2": "RNA"
  options:
    A: "Deoxyribose sugar; uses thymine (T)"
    B: "Ribose sugar; uses uracil (U)"
  answer: {"1":"A","2":"B"}
  explain: "DNA uses deoxyribose and T, whereas RNA uses ribose and U instead of T."
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "What is the difference between purines and pyrimidines in DNA bases? Give one example of each."
  answer: "Purines have a two-ring structure (A and G), while pyrimidines have a single ring (C and T in DNA, plus U in RNA)."
  explain: "Ring number distinguishes purines (double-ring) from pyrimidines (single-ring), important for correct base pairing."

# FP8: Burrows’ 3 Rules of DNA (complementary pairing, directionality, antiparallel strands)
- type: MultiChoice
  text: "Which of the following is part of Burrows’ 3 rules for DNA?"
  choices:
    A: "DNA is built 3' → 5'"
    B: "DNA strands are parallel and run in the same direction"
    C: "A pairs with T, and G pairs with C"
    D: "DNA contains equal amounts of ribose and deoxyribose"
  answer: C
  explain: "Complementary base pairing (A–T, G–C), 5' → 3' synthesis, and antiparallel strand orientation are central rules highlighted in lecture."
- type: TrueFalse
  text: "According to Burrows’ rules, DNA polymerases add new nucleotides to a strand in the 5' → 3' direction."
  answer: true
  explain: "DNA is described as directional and is built 5' → 3', adding new nucleotides to the 3' –OH end."
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "What does it mean that DNA strands are antiparallel, and why is this important for replication?"
  answer: "Antiparallel means the two strands run in opposite directions (one 5' → 3', the other 3' → 5'); this orientation allows complementary base pairing and determines how replication enzymes move along each strand."
  explain: "Antiparallel structure constrains replication to 5' → 3' synthesis, leading to distinct leading and lagging strands."

# FP9: Hydrogen bonds vs phosphodiester bonds in DNA
- type: MultiChoice
  text: "Which bonds hold complementary bases together in the center of the DNA double helix?"
  choices:
    A: "Ionic bonds"
    B: "Hydrogen bonds"
    C: "Peptide bonds"
    D: "Phosphodiester bonds"
  answer: B
  explain: "Hydrogen bonds form between base pairs: A–T (2 bonds) and G–C (3 bonds), allowing the strands to separate during replication."
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "What type of bond links nucleotides together along the sugar-phosphate backbone, and is it strong or weak compared with hydrogen bonds?"
  answer: "Phosphodiester bonds link nucleotides in the backbone; they are strong covalent bonds, much stronger than hydrogen bonds between bases."
  explain: "Covalent phosphodiester bonds provide structural stability, while weaker hydrogen bonds allow the strands to separate when needed."
- type: TrueFalse
  text: "When DNA replicates, hydrogen bonds between bases are broken, but phosphodiester bonds in the backbone remain intact on each original strand."
  answer: true
  explain: "Replication unzips base pairs (hydrogen bonds), leaving each original backbone intact as a template for new strand synthesis."

# FP10: Double helix and contributions of Rosalind Franklin vs Watson and Crick
- type: MultiChoice
  text: "What did Rosalind Franklin’s famous X-ray diffraction image reveal about DNA?"
  choices:

    B: "DNA is a triple helix of sugars"
    C: "DNA has a helical, repeating structure"
    D: "DNA is made only of proteins"
  answer: C
  explain: "The X-ray pattern indicated a helical, regular structure, providing key evidence for the double-helix model."
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "How did Watson and Crick use Franklin’s data and Chargaff’s rule to build their DNA model?"
  answer: "They combined helical dimensions from Franklin’s X-ray data with Chargaff’s base-ratio rules to propose a double helix with specific base pairing (A–T and G–C)."
  explain: "Their model explained both the diffraction pattern and base ratios by arranging two antiparallel strands with complementary base pairing."
- type: TrueFalse
  text: "Watson and Crick worked in isolation and did not rely on any other scientists’ data to create their DNA model."
  answer: false
  explain: "They drew heavily on data from Franklin and others, plus Chargaff’s findings, to rapidly assemble a consistent model."

# FP11: Gel electrophoresis and applications (COVID PCR, paternity testing)
- type: MultiChoice
  text: "What does gel electrophoresis do when used on DNA samples?"
  choices:
    A: "Copies DNA many times"
    B: "Separates DNA fragments based on size"
    C: "Sequencess DNA base by base"
    D: "Destroys DNA so it cannot be analyzed"
  answer: B
  explain: "An electric field pulls DNA fragments through a gel matrix; smaller fragments travel farther than larger ones, separating them by size."
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "How could gel electrophoresis be used together with PCR to test for a viral infection like COVID-19?"
  answer: "PCR amplifies a specific viral DNA fragment (or cDNA), and gel electrophoresis reveals whether a band of the expected size appears; a band indicates that viral genetic material was present in the sample."
  explain: "The presence or absence of a specific-size band after PCR gives a visual yes/no answer about viral sequence presence."
- type: Matching
  text: "In a paternity test using gel electrophoresis, how are a child’s DNA bands compared to potential parents?"
  pairs:
    "1": "Bands that match the child but not one tested parent"
    "2": "Bands present in the child and both tested parents"
  options:
    A: "Help identify the other biological parent"
    B: "Show shared human DNA regions but do not distinguish parentage alone"
  answer: {"1":"A","2":"B"}
  explain: "Each band in the child must come from one parent or the other; unmatched bands suggest which adult is (or is not) a biological parent."

# FP12: Sanger sequencing basics
- type: MultiChoice
  text: "Which key feature makes Sanger DNA sequencing possible?"
  choices:
    A: "Use of heat to break all phosphodiester bonds"
    B: "Use of chain-terminating nucleotides that stop DNA synthesis at specific bases"
    C: "Use of only one type of nucleotide"
    D: "Use of RNA polymerase instead of DNA polymerase"
  answer: B
  explain: "Sanger sequencing incorporates modified nucleotides that stop elongation; the resulting fragments can be separated and read to determine sequence."
- type: TrueFalse
  text: "In Sanger sequencing, a laser can be used to read differently colored labels on terminated fragments, revealing the base at each position."
  answer: true
  explain: "Each type of chain-terminating nucleotide is fluorescently labeled, so fragment color at each length tells which base was added last."
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "Why is gel or capillary electrophoresis still important in Sanger sequencing, even when fluorescent labels are used?"
  answer: "Electrophoresis separates DNA fragments by length so that each position in the sequence can be read in order from smallest to largest fragment."
  explain: "Without size separation, the mixture of fragments would overlap and you could not tell which base corresponds to each position."

# FP13: DNA packaging in prokaryotes vs eukaryotes, euchromatin vs heterochromatin
- type: MultiChoice
  text: "How is bacterial DNA primarily packaged compared with eukaryotic DNA?"
  choices:
    A: "Bacteria use multiple linear chromosomes; eukaryotes use a single circular chromosome"
    B: "Bacteria supercoil a single circular chromosome; eukaryotes wrap multiple linear chromosomes around histone proteins"
    C: "Both bacteria and eukaryotes use nucleosomes and histones"
    D: "Bacteria and eukaryotes leave DNA fully extended without packaging"
  answer: B
  explain: "Bacteria compact their single circular chromosome by supercoiling, while eukaryotes organize DNA into nucleosomes and higher-order chromatin."
- type: Matching
  text: "Match each eukaryotic DNA state with its description."
  pairs:
    "1": "Euchromatin"
    "2": "Heterochromatin"
  options:
    A: "Open, less condensed DNA that is generally accessible and expressed"
    B: "Tightly wound DNA that is less accessible and usually not expressed"
  answer: {"1":"A","2":"B"}
  explain: "Euchromatin corresponds to active, open regions; heterochromatin is compacted and typically transcriptionally silent."
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "Why is complex DNA packaging necessary in human cells, and what is one consequence for gene expression?"
  answer: "Human cells must fit about 2 meters of DNA into a tiny nucleus, so extensive packaging is needed; tightly packed regions (heterochromatin) are generally not expressed, while more open regions (euchromatin) can be transcribed."
  explain: "Packaging solves the space problem but also regulates which genes are accessible for transcription."

# FP14: DNA replication models and Meselson–Stahl experiment
- type: MultiChoice
  text: "Which model of DNA replication was supported by Meselson and Stahl’s experiment using heavy and light nitrogen?"
  choices:
    A: "Conservative"
    B: "Semiconservative"
    C: "Dispersive"
    D: "Random"
  answer: B
  explain: "After one and two rounds of replication, the density patterns matched predictions for semiconservative replication, where each new DNA molecule has one old and one new strand."
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "What did Meselson and Stahl label with heavy nitrogen (¹⁵N) in E. coli, and how did ultracentrifugation help them interpret replication models?"
  answer: "They labeled DNA with heavy nitrogen; ultracentrifugation separated heavy and light DNA, allowing them to see intermediate and light bands that distinguished semiconservative replication from other models."
  explain: "By tracking density shifts over generations, they showed that old strands are split between daughter molecules, not kept together or completely mixed."
- type: TrueFalse
  text: "In semiconservative replication, each daughter DNA molecule contains two newly synthesized strands."
  answer: false
  explain: "Each daughter molecule contains one original (parent) strand and one newly synthesized strand, which is why it is called semiconservative."

# FP15: DNA replication problems and 'enzyme for every problem'
- type: MultiChoice
  text: "Which list correctly pairs a replication problem with the enzyme that helps solve it?"
  choices:
    A: "Unwinding the helix — ligase; starting synthesis — DNA polymerase III"
    B: "Unwinding the helix — helicase; starting synthesis — primase"
    C: "Proofreading — helicase; sealing gaps — primase"
    D: "Removing primers — DNA polymerase III; sealing gaps — primase"
  answer: B
  explain: "Helicase unwinds DNA; primase makes short RNA primers with free 3' –OH ends so DNA polymerase can start."
- type: Matching
  text: "Match each replication problem from the lecture list to the enzyme that primarily addresses it."
  pairs:
    "1": "Need to unzip the double helix"
    "2": "Need a 3' OH to start DNA synthesis"
    "3": "Need to seal gaps in the sugar-phosphate backbone"
  options:
    A: "Helicase"
    B: "Primase"
    C: "DNA ligase"
  answer: {"1":"A","2":"B","3":"C"}
  explain: "Helicase unwinds, primase provides primers, and ligase seals nicks where backbone gaps remain."
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "Why can we say there is 'an enzyme to solve every problem' in DNA replication? Give one example."
  answer: "DNA replication raises specific challenges (unwinding, starting synthesis, accuracy, sealing gaps), and cells have specialized enzymes—like helicase, primase, DNA polymerases, and ligase—that each tackle a different problem."
  explain: "Replication is a coordinated team effort where different enzymes handle different steps to copy DNA accurately and efficiently."

# FP16: DNA polymerase, directionality, and leading vs lagging strands
- type: MultiChoice
  text: "Why do cells need both a leading and a lagging strand during DNA replication?"
  choices:
    A: "Because DNA polymerase can only synthesize 3' → 5'"
    B: "Because the two template strands run antiparallel but DNA polymerase can only synthesize 5' → 3'"
    C: "Because helicase works only on one strand"
    D: "Because one strand has more adenine than the other"
  answer: B
  explain: "The antiparallel nature of DNA and the 5' → 3' requirement force one strand to be made continuously (leading) and the other in fragments (lagging)."
- type: TrueFalse
  text: "DNA polymerase joins the 5' phosphate of a new nucleotide to the 3' OH of the growing strand, forming a phosphodiester bond."
  answer: true
  explain: "This chemistry defines the 5' → 3' direction of synthesis and explains why a free 3' –OH is needed."
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "What are Okazaki fragments, and on which strand do they form?"
  answer: "They are short DNA fragments synthesized discontinuously on the lagging strand."
  explain: "Because the lagging strand runs the 'wrong' direction relative to fork movement, it must be synthesized in short pieces later joined by ligase."

# FP17: Proofreading, accuracy, and DNA repair enzymes
- type: MultiChoice
  text: "What is one reason actual mutation rates are much lower than the raw error rate of DNA polymerase III?"
  choices:
    A: "Replication happens only once per lifetime"
    B: "Cells avoid using DNA polymerase entirely"
    C: "DNA polymerases and repair enzymes proofread and correct many errors"
    D: "Mismatched bases are not stable in DNA"
  answer: C
  explain: "DNA polymerase I and other repair systems scan for mismatches and damage, removing and replacing incorrect bases."
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "How does DNA polymerase I help both with primer removal and error correction on the lagging strand?"
  answer: "It has exonuclease activity to remove RNA primers and mismatched bases, then fills the gaps with correct DNA nucleotides."
  explain: "Pol I cuts out primers (and errors) and replaces them with DNA, linking replication and repair."
- type: TrueFalse
  text: "Even with proofreading and repair, DNA replication is still imperfect and some mutations slip through."
  answer: true
  explain: "Error correction greatly reduces but does not completely eliminate mistakes, leaving a small but important mutation rate."

# FP18: Prokaryotic replication origin and fork dynamics
- type: MultiChoice
  text: "Where does DNA replication start on a bacterial chromosome?"
  choices:
    A: "At random positions each time"
    B: "At the origin of replication (oriC)"
    C: "At every promoter"
    D: "Only at the chromosome ends"
  answer: B
  explain: "Replication begins at a specific sequence, oriC, and proceeds bidirectionally around the circular chromosome."
- type: Matching
  text: "Match each replication structure or term with its description in a bacterial cell."
  pairs:
    "1": "Origin of replication"
    "2": "Replication fork"
  options:
    A: "Y-shaped region where helicase, polymerases, and other enzymes are actively copying DNA"
    B: "Specific DNA sequence where replication begins"
  answer: {"1":"B","2":"A"}
  explain: "The origin is the starting point; the replication fork is the moving machine that does the copying."
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "Why must bacterial cells replicate their DNA before dividing?"
  answer: "So that each daughter cell receives a complete copy of the genome."
  explain: "Division without prior replication would leave some daughter cells missing essential genetic information."

# FP19: Eukaryotic replication challenges and multiple origins
- type: MultiChoice
  text: "Why do eukaryotic chromosomes have many origins of replication instead of just one like bacteria?"
  choices:
    A: "Eukaryotes do not use helicase"
    B: "Their genomes are much larger, so multiple origins allow faster replication"
    C: "Their chromosomes are circular"
    D: "They lack DNA polymerase"
  answer: B
  explain: "Multiple origins let replication begin at many sites at once, shortening the time needed to copy long linear chromosomes."
- type: TrueFalse
  text: "Replication mechanisms in eukaryotes and prokaryotes share core principles but differ in details such as origin number and chromosome structure."
  answer: true
  explain: "Both follow 5' → 3' synthesis, semiconservative replication, and use similar enzymes, but eukaryotes have multiple origins and linear chromosomes."
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "Name one way eukaryotic DNA replication is similar to prokaryotic replication and one key difference."
  answer: "Similar: both use semiconservative replication with helicase, primase, and DNA polymerases; different: eukaryotes have multiple origins and linear chromosomes with telomeres, whereas bacteria usually have one circular chromosome with a single origin."
  explain: "Core chemistry is conserved, but genome size and chromosome shape force eukaryotes to use additional strategies."

# FP20: End-replication problem, telomeres, and loss of repeats
- type: MultiChoice
  text: "What problem arises when replicating the very ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes?"
  choices:
    A: "They are over-replicated and become longer each cycle"
    B: "The RNA primers at the ends cannot be replaced with DNA, so a little bit of sequence is lost each division"
    C: "The ends contain no DNA at all"
    D: "Only bacterial chromosomes have this issue"
  answer: B
  explain: "When primers are removed from the extreme 5' ends, polymerase cannot fill the gap, causing gradual shortening of chromosome ends."
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "What are telomeres, and what type of sequence do they contain?"
  answer: "Telomeres are repetitive DNA caps at the ends of linear chromosomes (in humans, repeated TTAGGG sequences) that protect coding DNA from being lost."
  explain: "They act as disposable buffers so that essential genes are not truncated as chromosomes shorten with each division."
- type: TrueFalse
  text: "If eukaryotic chromosomes had no telomeres, important genes at the ends of chromosomes could be lost as cells divide."
  answer: true
  explain: "Without protective repeats, shortening would directly damage coding or regulatory sequences, threatening cell survival."

# FP21: Telomerase, germ line cells, and cancer
- type: MultiChoice
  text: "What is the main function of telomerase in cells that express it?"
  choices:
    A: "To remove telomeres entirely"
    B: "To add repetitive sequences to telomeres and counteract shortening"
    C: "To cut chromosomes into smaller pieces"
    D: "To repair phosphodiester bonds in the middle of genes"
  answer: B
  explain: "Telomerase extends telomeric repeats, helping maintain chromosome length in cells that must divide many times."
- type: TrueFalse
  text: "Germ line cells normally have active telomerase, and many cancer cells re-activate telomerase to help them divide indefinitely."
  answer: true
  explain: "Germ cells need long-term replicative capacity; cancers often hijack telomerase to avoid telomere-driven limits on division."
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "Why might drugs that inhibit telomerase be considered as potential cancer treatments?"
  answer: "Because blocking telomerase in cancer cells could allow their telomeres to shorten, eventually limiting their ability to keep dividing."
  explain: "Targeting telomerase could selectively reduce the 'immortality' of tumor cells that depend on telomere maintenance."

# FP22: Mutation and DNA repair (intro)
- type: MultiChoice
  text: "Which best defines a mutation as introduced in the DNA repair lecture slide?"
  choices:
    A: "Any temporary change in protein shape"
    B: "A change in the DNA sequence"
    C: "A change in RNA that is not copied"
    D: "A reversible change in chromatin packing"
  answer: B
  explain: "A mutation is a change in the nucleotide sequence of DNA, which can be passed on when DNA is replicated."
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "Why are DNA repair mechanisms important for cells and organisms?"
  answer: "They detect and correct some DNA damage and mistakes, lowering mutation rates and helping prevent diseases and cell malfunction."
  explain: "Without repair, errors would accumulate faster, increasing the risk of harmful mutations and genomic instability."
- type: TrueFalse
  text: "DNA repair systems can correct every mutation, so mutations never contribute to evolution."
  answer: false
  explain: "Repair reduces but does not eliminate mutations; remaining changes provide genetic variation on which evolution can act."

- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "Griffith described a mysterious 'transforming principle.' What did this term refer to in his experiment?"
  answer: "Some material released from heat-killed virulent bacteria that could convert non-virulent bacteria into virulent forms."
  explain: "Griffith did not know the chemical identity, but he recognized that something from dead virulent cells permanently changed the traits of live non-virulent cells."
- type: TrueFalse
  text: "Griffith’s experiment showed that the ability to cause disease can be transferred between bacteria by a stable heritable factor."
  answer: true
  explain: "Because non-virulent bacteria became virulent and passed this trait on, his work implied a heritable 'transforming principle' existed."

- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "How could gel electrophoresis be used together with PCR to test for a viral infection like COVID-19?"
  answer: "PCR amplifies a specific viral DNA fragment (or cDNA), and gel electrophoresis reveals whether a band of the expected size appears; a band indicates that viral genetic material was present in the sample."
  explain: "The presence or absence of a specific-size band after PCR gives a visual yes/no answer about viral sequence presence."
- type: Matching
  text: "In a paternity test using gel electrophoresis, how are a child’s DNA bands compared to potential parents?"

- type: TrueFalse
  text: "In Sanger sequencing, a laser can be used to read differently colored labels on terminated fragments, revealing the base at each position."
  answer: true
  explain: "Each type of chain-terminating nucleotide is fluorescently labeled, so fragment color at each length tells which base was added last."
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "Why is gel or capillary electrophoresis still important in Sanger sequencing, even when fluorescent labels are used?"
  answer: "Electrophoresis separates DNA fragments by length so that each position in the sequence can be read in order from smallest to largest fragment."
  explain: "Without size separation, the mixture of fragments would overlap and you could not tell which base corresponds to each position."

# FP13: DNA packaging in prokaryotes vs eukaryotes, euchromatin vs heterochromatin

    C: "Dispersive"
    D: "Random"
  answer: B
  explain: "After one and two rounds of replication, the density patterns matched predictions for semiconservative replication, where each new DNA molecule has one old and one new strand."
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "What did Meselson and Stahl label with heavy nitrogen (¹⁵N) in E. coli, and how did ultracentrifugation help them interpret replication models?"
  answer: "They labeled DNA with heavy nitrogen; ultracentrifugation separated heavy and light DNA, allowing them to see intermediate and light bands that distinguished semiconservative replication from other models."
  explain: "By tracking density shifts over generations, they showed that old strands are split between daughter molecules, not kept together or completely mixed."
- type: TrueFalse
  text: "In semiconservative replication, each daughter DNA molecule contains two newly synthesized strands."
  answer: false
  explain: "Each daughter molecule contains one original (parent) strand and one newly synthesized strand, which is why it is called semiconservative."

- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "Why can we say there is 'an enzyme to solve every problem' in DNA replication? Give one example."
  answer: "DNA replication raises specific challenges (unwinding, starting synthesis, accuracy, sealing gaps), and cells have specialized enzymes—like helicase, primase, DNA polymerases, and ligase—that each tackle a different problem."
  explain: "Replication is a coordinated team effort where different enzymes handle different steps to copy DNA accurately and efficiently."

# FP16: DNA polymerase, directionality, and leading vs lagging strands
- type: MultiChoice
  text: "Why do cells need both a leading and a lagging strand during DNA replication?"
  choices:
    A: "Because DNA polymerase can only synthesize 3' → 5'"
    B: "Because the two template strands run antiparallel but DNA polymerase can only synthesize 5' → 3'"
    C: "Because helicase works only on one strand"
    D: "Because one strand has more adenine than the other"
  answer: B
  explain: "The antiparallel nature of DNA and the 5' → 3' requirement force one strand to be made continuously (leading) and the other in fragments (lagging)."
- type: TrueFalse
  text: "DNA polymerase joins the 5' phosphate of a new nucleotide to the 3' OH of the growing strand, forming a phosphodiester bond."
  answer: true

  text: "Replication mechanisms in eukaryotes and prokaryotes share core principles but differ in details such as origin number and chromosome structure."
  answer: true
  explain: "Both follow 5' → 3' synthesis, semiconservative replication, and use similar enzymes, but eukaryotes have multiple origins and linear chromosomes."
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "Name one way eukaryotic DNA replication is similar to prokaryotic replication and one key difference."
  answer: "Similar: both use semiconservative replication with helicase, primase, and DNA polymerases; different: eukaryotes have multiple origins and linear chromosomes with telomeres, whereas bacteria usually have one circular chromosome with a single origin."
  explain: "Core chemistry is conserved, but genome size and chromosome shape force eukaryotes to use additional strategies."

# FP20: End-replication problem, telomeres, and loss of repeats
- type: MultiChoice
  text: "What problem arises when replicating the very ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes?"
  choices:
    A: "They are over-replicated and become longer each cycle"
    B: "The RNA primers at the ends cannot be replaced with DNA, so a little bit of sequence is lost each division"
    C: "The ends contain no DNA at all"
    D: "Only bacterial chromosomes have this issue"
  answer: B
  explain: "When primers are removed from the extreme 5' ends, polymerase cannot fill the gap, causing gradual shortening of chromosome ends."
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "What are telomeres, and what type of sequence do they contain?"
  answer: "Telomeres are repetitive DNA caps at the ends of linear chromosomes (in humans, repeated TTAGGG sequences) that protect coding DNA from being lost."
  explain: "They act as disposable buffers so that essential genes are not truncated as chromosomes shorten with each division."
- type: TrueFalse
  text: "If eukaryotic chromosomes had no telomeres, important genes at the ends of chromosomes could be lost as cells divide."
  answer: true
  explain: "Without protective repeats, shortening would directly damage coding or regulatory sequences, threatening cell survival."

- type: TrueFalse
  text: "Germ line cells normally have active telomerase, and many cancer cells re-activate telomerase to help them divide indefinitely."
  answer: true
  explain: "Germ cells need long-term replicative capacity; cancers often hijack telomerase to avoid telomere-driven limits on division."
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: "Why might drugs that inhibit telomerase be considered as potential cancer treatments?"
  answer: "Because blocking telomerase in cancer cells could allow their telomeres to shorten, eventually limiting their ability to keep dividing."
  explain: "Targeting telomerase could selectively reduce the 'immortality' of tumor cells that depend on telomere maintenance."

# FP1: Relating double-stranded DNA and mRNA orientation
- type: MultiChoice
  text: |
    You are given a double-stranded DNA and the mRNA transcribed from it:

      Top DNA strand:    CTGGATCCATGACGGGATTGTTCATGGACTGATCAGGAAT
                         ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
      Bottom DNA strand: TACCTAGGTACTGCCCTAACAAGTACCTGACTAGTCCTTA

      mRNA: 5' CUGGAUCCAUGACGGGAUUGUUCAUGGACUGAUCAGGAAU 3'

    Which assignment of 5' and 3' ends to the DNA strands is correct?
  choices:
    A: "Top strand is 5' → 3' (as written left to right); bottom strand is 3' → 5' (as written)."
    B: "Top strand is 3' → 5' (as written); bottom strand is 5' → 3' (as written)."
    C: "Both strands run 5' → 3' from left to right."
    D: "Both strands run 3' → 5' from left to right."
  answer: A
  explain: |
    The mRNA is written 5' → 3'. The coding strand must match the mRNA sequence (except T ↔ U) and also run 5' → 3' in the same direction.
    Here the top DNA strand CTGGATCC… matches the mRNA CUGGAUCC… (T in DNA where U is in RNA), so the top strand must be the coding strand
    running 5' → 3' left to right. Because the strands are antiparallel, the bottom strand must run 3' → 5' left to right.
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: |
    Using the sequences from the previous question, explicitly label the 5' and 3' ends on the DNA:

      ___ CTGGATCCATGACGGGATTGTTCATGGACTGATCAGGAAT ___
      ___ TACCTAGGTACTGCCCTAACAAGTACCTGACTAGTCCTTA ___

    Fill in the blanks with 5' or 3' for each end.
  answer: |
    5' CTGGATCCATGACGGGATTGTTCATGGACTGATCAGGAAT 3'
    3' TACCTAGGTACTGCCCTAACAAGTACCTGACTAGTCCTTA 5'
  explain: |
    The strand whose sequence matches the mRNA (top strand) must be 5' → 3' in the same direction as the mRNA. The complementary strand is
    therefore 3' → 5' in that direction. Remember: in a standard drawing, if one strand is 5' → 3' left to right, the other must be 3' → 5' left to right.
- type: TrueFalse
  text: "In this example, the coding strand and the mRNA both run 5' → 3' in the same direction along the gene."
  answer: true
  explain: |
    The coding strand has the same base order as the mRNA (with T instead of U), and both are written 5' → 3' in the same direction. The template strand
    runs antiparallel (3' → 5') and is complementary to the mRNA.

# FP2: Identifying template vs coding strands from DNA and mRNA
- type: MultiChoice
  text: |
    You again have the same sequences:

      Top DNA strand:    5' CTGGATCCATGACGGGATTGTTCATGGACTGATCAGGAAT 3'
      Bottom DNA strand: 3' TACCTAGGTACTGCCCTAACAAGTACCTGACTAGTCCTTA 5'
      mRNA:              5' CUGGAUCCAUGACGGGAUUGUUCAUGGACUGAUCAGGAAU 3'

    Which statement about template and coding strands is correct?
  choices:
    A: "Top strand is coding; bottom strand is template."
    B: "Top strand is template; bottom strand is coding."
    C: "Both strands are coding strands."
    D: "Neither strand can be used as a template here."
  answer: A
  explain: |
    The coding strand matches the mRNA sequence, except that DNA uses T instead of U. The top strand CTGGATCC… matches CUGGAUCC… (T ↔ U), so
    it is the coding strand. The bottom strand is complementary and antiparallel, so it is the template strand used directly by RNA polymerase.
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: |
    Explain, in words, how you can decide which DNA strand is the template and which is the coding strand if you are given the mRNA sequence.
  answer: |
    Compare each DNA strand (written 5' → 3') to the mRNA (also written 5' → 3'). The strand whose 5' → 3' sequence matches the mRNA (except T in DNA
    where the mRNA has U) is the coding strand. The other strand, which is complementary and antiparallel to the mRNA, is the template strand that RNA
    polymerase actually reads.
  explain: |
    The template strand is the one RNA polymerase copies. The coding strand is not copied but shares the same sequence as the mRNA (T instead of U).
    This simple comparison is a reliable way to identify template vs coding in practice problems.
- type: TrueFalse
  text: "The template strand has the same 5' → 3' base sequence as the mRNA, except that it uses T instead of U."
  answer: false
  explain: |
    That statement describes the coding strand, not the template. The template strand is complementary to the mRNA and runs 3' → 5' relative to the
    direction of synthesis; the coding strand matches the mRNA sequence (T ↔ U) in the 5' → 3' direction.

# FP3: Translating an mRNA using the codon table
- type: MultiChoice
  text: |
    Using the same mRNA as in the practice problem:

      5' CUGGAUCCAUGACGGGAUUGUUCAUGGACUGAUCAGGAAU 3'

    Translation begins at the first AUG codon. Which amino acid sequence is produced (stop codon not included)?
  choices:
    A: "Leu – Asp – Pro – Trp – Thr – Gly – Leu – Phe – Met – Asp"
    B: "Met – Thr – Gly – Leu – Phe – Met – Asp"
    C: "Met – Thr – Gly – Leu – Leu – Val – Asp"
    D: "Met – Ala – Gly – Ile – Val – Met – Asp"
  answer: B
  explain: |
    1. Find the first AUG (start) codon in the mRNA: CUGGAUCC[AUG]ACGGGAUUGUUCAUGGACUGAUCAGGAAU.
    2. Starting at that AUG, group into codons:
         AUG ACG GGA UUG UUC AUG GAC UGA...
    3. Use the codon table:
         AUG → Met, ACG → Thr, GGA → Gly, UUG → Leu,
         UUC → Phe, AUG → Met, GAC → Asp, UGA → Stop.
    4. Stop translation at the stop codon UGA. Final peptide: Met – Thr – Gly – Leu – Phe – Met – Asp.
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: |
    Outline a step‑by‑step method a student should follow to translate any mRNA into an amino acid sequence using a codon table.
  answer: |
    1. Make sure the mRNA is written 5' → 3'.
    2. Scan from the 5' end to find the first AUG start codon.
    3. Starting at that AUG, divide the sequence into non‑overlapping groups of three bases (codons).
    4. Look up each codon in the codon table to find its amino acid.
    5. Continue until you reach a stop codon (UAA, UAG, or UGA), which does not code for an amino acid.
    6. Write the amino acid sequence from the start codon to the last amino acid before the stop.
  explain: |
    These steps mirror how ribosomes translate mRNA in the cell. Practicing this algorithm on multiple sequences will make codon‑table problems routine.
- type: TrueFalse
  text: "Any bases before the first AUG in a eukaryotic mRNA are part of the 5' UTR and are not translated into amino acids."
  answer: true
  explain: |
    The ribosome scans from the 5' end until it finds the first AUG. Bases before that are untranslated (5' UTR), even though they are part of the mRNA.

# FP4: Identifying template vs coding from a transcription diagram
- type: MultiChoice
  text: |
    In a textbook diagram, an mRNA strand is shown base‑paired to the TOP DNA strand. The bottom DNA strand is parallel but not paired to the mRNA.
    Which strand is the template strand in that diagram?
  choices:
    A: "The top DNA strand is the template strand."
    B: "The bottom DNA strand is the template strand."
    C: "Both strands are template strands."
    D: "Neither strand can be a template if mRNA is shown."
  answer: A
  explain: |
    The template strand is the one that the mRNA is complementary to and base‑paired with. If the mRNA is drawn paired with the top strand, that top
    strand must be the template. The coding strand will be unpaired and will match the mRNA sequence (T ↔ U) in the 5' → 3' direction.
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: |
    A diagram shows an RNA transcript being built directly from the top DNA strand. Describe how you can use that information alone to label the top
    and bottom strands as template and coding.
  answer: |
    If the RNA is being synthesized from the top strand, that top strand must be the template strand, because RNA polymerase always uses the template
    as the base‑pairing guide. The bottom strand, which is not used and instead has the same 5' → 3' sequence as the RNA (with T instead of U),
    is the coding strand.
  explain: |
    In diagrams, focus on which strand the RNA touches and base‑pairs with—that is always the template strand. The opposite strand is coding.
- type: TrueFalse
  text: "In any transcription diagram, the DNA strand whose 5' → 3' sequence matches the RNA (except T vs U) is the template strand."
  answer: false
  explain: |
    That describes the coding strand, not the template. The template is complementary to the RNA and is the one the polymerase actually reads.

# FP5: Labeling 5' and 3' ends from replication arrows
- type: MultiChoice
  text: |
    In a replication diagram, short DNA fragments are shown with arrows at one end indicating the direction of synthesis (the direction in which
    DNA polymerase is moving). According to the key on your practice sheet, what does the arrowed end of each fragment represent?
  choices:
    A: "The 5' end of the fragment."
    B: "The 3' end of the fragment."
    C: "The origin of replication."
    D: "The template strand."
  answer: B
  explain: |
    DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to a free 3' OH, so the direction of synthesis is always toward the 3' end of the growing strand.
    The key notes that “all of the ends with arrows will be the 3' ends,” so the other end of each fragment must be the 5' end.
- type: ShortAnswer
  text: |
    Explain why the arrowheads on newly synthesized DNA fragments correspond to 3' ends rather than 5' ends.
  answer: |
    DNA polymerases add new nucleotides only to a free 3' OH group, extending the strand in the 5' → 3' direction. The arrow shows the direction
    of strand growth, so it must point at the 3' end, where new nucleotides are being added.
  explain: |
    Remember the rule: DNA is synthesized 5' → 3'. Wherever synthesis is moving toward, that end of the new strand is the 3' end. The opposite end
    is therefore the 5' end.
- type: TrueFalse
  text: "If you know which direction a new DNA strand is being extended in a replication diagram, you can always label its 5' and 3' ends correctly."
  answer: true
  explain: |
    Because synthesis always proceeds 5' → 3', the direction of extension tells you which end is 3' (in the direction of growth) and which is 5'
    (the end from which the strand started). This rule lets you label 5'/3' ends even when they are not explicitly marked.
