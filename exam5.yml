- answer: C
  choices:
    A: detergent
    B: lysis buffer
    C: alcohol
    D: enzymes
  explain: "The correct answer is 'alcohol' because cold alcohol (often ethanol or\
    \ isopropanol) decreases DNA\u2019s solubility and causes the long, negatively\
    \ charged DNA strands to aggregate and fall out of solution as a visible solid.\
    \ This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying\
    \ mechanisms and reasoning step by step."

- answer: C
  choices:
    A: polymerase enzymes
    B: helicase enzymes
    C: restriction enzymes
    D: ligase enzymes
  explain: The correct answer is 'restriction enzymes' because these are DNA-cutting
    enzymes that recognize specific palindromic sequences and cleave the phosphodiester
    backbone at or near those sites, generating defined DNA fragments. This explanation
    elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms
    and reasoning step by step.

  type: MultiChoice
- answer: C
  choices:
    A: CRISPR
    B: Fluorescence
    C: Recombination
    D: Mitosis
  explain: The correct answer is 'Recombination' because genetic maps are built by
    measuring how frequently alleles are separated by crossing over during meiosis;
    higher recombination frequency indicates greater distance between loci. This explanation
    elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms
    and reasoning step by step.
  text: Genetic mapping relies on what process?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: A DNA molecule that has been artificially formed by joining DNA from two
    or more different sources, often from different organisms.

    (for example, a human gene inserted into a bacterial plasmid) are ligated together
    into a single DNA molecule that can be replicated and expressed. This explanation
    elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms

  type: ShortAnswer
- answer: C
  choices:
    A: sequence
    B: source
    C: size
    D: color
  explain: The correct answer is 'size' because in an agarose gel, smaller DNA fragments
    move more quickly through the pores toward the positive electrode, while larger
    fragments move more slowly, creating a size-dependent band pattern. This explanation
    elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms
    and reasoning step by step.

  type: MultiChoice
- answer: "The E. coli DNA polymerase would denature at 95\xB0C and lose activity,\
    \ causing PCR amplification to fail."
  explain: "Standard E. coli DNA polymerase is not thermostable and unfolds at high\
    \ temperatures, so after the first denaturation step it would be inactivated.\
    \ Taq polymerase from Thermus aquaticus is heat-stable and survives repeated 95\xB0\
    C cycles, which is why it is used in PCR. This explanation elaborates the biological\
    \ principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by\
    \ step."

- answer: A
  choices:
    A: Primers
    B: Probes
    C: ddNTPs
    D: Ligase
  explain: The correct answer is 'Primers' because short, synthetic DNA primers define
    the start and end points of the target region. They anneal to complementary sequences
    on the template and provide free 3' OH groups for DNA polymerase to extend. This
    explanation elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying
    mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: What is added to PCR to amplify a specific region of DNA sequence?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: By incorporating fluorescently labeled chain-terminating ddNTPs, each nucleotide
    type tagged with a different color, so the terminal ddNTP in each fragment reveals
    which base is at that position.
  explain: In Sanger sequencing, DNA synthesis occasionally incorporates a dideoxynucleotide
    (ddATP, ddTTP, ddCTP, or ddGTP) that prevents further extension. Each ddNTP has
    a unique fluorescent dye, so when fragments are separated by size in a capillary,
    the color of the fluorescence at each length identifies whether the base is A,
    T, C, or G. This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved, describing
    underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.

    often by delivering a working copy of a defective gene (or editing the existing\
    \ copy) so that cells can make the correct protein and restore normal function.\
    \ This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying\
    \ mechanisms and reasoning step by step."
  text: What is the goal of gene therapy?
  type: ShortAnswer
- answer: A genetic map orders genes based on recombination frequencies (how often
    they are inherited together), while a physical map shows the actual physical positions
    and distances between DNA sequences measured in base pairs.
  explain: Genetic maps are built from linkage data and give relative distances in
    map units or centimorgans, which reflect crossing-over frequency. Physical maps
    come from sequencing or direct DNA analysis and place genes at precise locations
    along chromosomes in terms of base-pair coordinates. This explanation elaborates
    the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning
    step by step.

- answer: A
  choices:
    A: probes
    B: DNA polymerase
    C: CRISPR
    D: primers
  explain: The correct answer is 'probes' because FISH uses fluorescently labeled
    DNA (or RNA) probes that are complementary to a target sequence; these probes
    hybridize directly to chromosomes or nuclei, making the position of the gene visible
    under a fluorescence microscope. This explanation elaborates the biological principles
    involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.

- answer: C
  choices:
    A: a genetic map
    B: an adenovirus

    of DNA sequence assembled by aligning and merging multiple overlapping sequence
    reads into a single, longer consensus sequence. This explanation elaborates the
    biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning
    step by step.

- answer: Reproductive cloning produces a whole new organism genetically identical
    (or nearly identical) to the donor, whereas molecular cloning copies specific
    DNA fragments or genes, usually by inserting them into vectors for amplification
    in cells.
  explain: "In reproductive cloning (such as somatic cell nuclear transfer in animals),\
    \ the goal is a cloned individual. In molecular cloning, the goal is to isolate\
    \ and amplify DNA segments\u2014for example, putting a gene into a plasmid and\
    \ propagating it in bacteria for study or protein production. This explanation\
    \ elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms\
    \ and reasoning step by step."

- answer: A
  choices:
    A: stem cells
    B: gametes
    C: meiosis
    D: germ line cells
  explain: The correct answer is 'stem cells' because stem cells are undifferentiated
    cells that retain the capacity to divide and to specialize into various cell types,
    unlike gametes or already differentiated somatic cells. This explanation elaborates
    the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning
    step by step.
  text: In animals undifferentiated cells are known as ___________.
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: "Because the genome is essentially the same in both cell types, but the\
    \ proteome\u2014the set of proteins expressed and their levels\u2014differs dramatically,\
    \ so proteomics reveals functional differences between brain and liver cells."
  explain: Genomics would show the same DNA sequence in both tissues, offering little
    insight into why they behave differently. Proteomics analyzes which proteins are
    present, in what amounts, and with what modifications, directly reflecting cell-specific
    functions and states. This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved,
    describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.

    \ cells, why might we want to use proteomics rather than genomics?"
  type: ShortAnswer
- answer: Next generation sequencing runs millions of sequencing reactions in parallel
    on many fragmented templates, generating huge amounts of data at once, whereas
    Sanger sequencing reads one DNA fragment (or a small number) at a time using capillary
    electrophoresis.
  explain: NGS platforms immobilize many DNA fragments on a surface or in wells and
    sequence them simultaneously, greatly increasing throughput and lowering cost
    per base. Sanger sequencing relies on individual chain-termination reactions and
    capillary separation for each template, making it slower and lower throughput.
    This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying
    mechanisms and reasoning step by step.

- answer: D
  choices:
    A: protein sequences
    B: primer sequences
    C: gene sequences

    B: Enzymes digesting proteins
    C: Cold alcohol added to the lysate
    D: Lysis buffer adjusting the pH
  explain: Cold alcohol (such as ethanol or isopropanol) lowers the solubility of
    DNA and neutralizes its charge, causing long DNA strands to clump together and
    become visible as a precipitate. This explanation elaborates the biological principles
    involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: In a DNA extraction from cells, what causes dissolved DNA to become solid
    and precipitate out of solution?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: "DNA is highly charged and normally dissolves well in water, but when cold\
    \ alcohol is added, the environment becomes less polar and salts help neutralize\
    \ the DNA\u2019s charge, so the long DNA molecules clump together and come out\
    \ of solution."

    D: Histone proteins
  explain: Sanger sequencing includes small amounts of ddNTPs that lack a 3' OH group.
    When incorporated, they stop elongation, producing a mixture of fragments that
    end at every possible position; their labels allow the base at each position to
    be identified. This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved,
    describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: What special component is added in Sanger sequencing that allows the DNA sequence
    to be read?
  type: MultiChoice

  choices:
    A: A genetic map shows actual DNA sequence; a physical map shows recombination
      frequencies.
    B: A genetic map is based on recombination frequencies between genes; a physical
      map shows actual physical positions or base-pair distances along DNA.
    C: There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable.
    D: A genetic map only exists for humans; a physical map only exists for bacteria.
  explain: Genetic maps are built from how often genes are inherited together (recombination
    data), whereas physical maps use molecular techniques to determine actual distances
    in base pairs and order along the chromosome. This explanation elaborates the
    biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning
    step by step.

      s complementary sequence on the chromosome"
    C: By staining chromosomes with a non-specific dye that binds all DNA
    D: By measuring the mass of each chromosome
  explain: FISH uses a single-stranded DNA probe with a fluorescent tag. The probe
    hybridizes (base-pairs) to its complementary sequence on chromosomes fixed on
    a slide, and the location of the gene is seen as a fluorescent spot under the
    microscope. This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved, describing
    underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.

      then using computers to assemble the overlapping sequences
    C: Sequencing only RNA molecules instead of DNA
    D: Sequencing only repetitive DNA regions
  explain: Shotgun sequencing randomly shears the genome, sequences large numbers
    of small pieces, and uses overlapping regions between fragments to computationally
    reconstruct the original genome sequence. This explanation elaborates the biological
    principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: What is the basic idea of shotgun genome sequencing?
  type: MultiChoice

  choices:
    A: Unique single-copy genes
    B: Highly repetitive DNA sequences
    C: Mitochondrial DNA
    D: Short exons in protein-coding genes
  explain: Highly repetitive DNA (such as long tandem repeats or transposable element
    repeats) produces many nearly identical reads, making it difficult for assembly
    software to tell exactly how many repeats are present and how they are ordered.
    This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying
    mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: Which type of DNA is especially problematic for shotgun sequencing and assembly?
  type: MultiChoice

    cannot easily determine how many times the repeat occurs or where each repeat
    copy belongs, leading to gaps or misassembled regions.
  explain: This answer correctly points out that the lack of unique sequence in repeats
    makes it hard to place reads in the correct genomic position. This explanation

    C: Because the proteome is identical in every cell type and condition.
    D: Because protein sequences are easier to read than DNA sequences.
  explain: "Studying the proteome reveals which proteins are actually present, how\

    D: They obtain extra genes from their environment as they differentiate.
  explain: All somatic cells in an individual share essentially the same genome, but
    each cell type turns on (expresses) only a subset of its genes. Differential gene
    expression produces different sets of RNAs and proteins in each cell type, which
    leads to distinct structures and functions. This explanation elaborates the biological

- answer: To conserve energy and resources by only making proteins when they are needed,
    and to respond to changing conditions or developmental cues so the cell can specialize
    (differentiate) into a particular cell type.
  explain: Gene regulation prevents the wasteful production of RNAs and proteins that
    are not needed at a given time, saving ATP and raw materials. It also allows cells
    to adjust their gene expression in response to environmental signals and developmental
    programs, enabling specialized cell types and proper responses to stress or pathogens.

  text: List two major reasons a cell would actively regulate (turn up or turn down)
    expression of its genes instead of expressing everything all the time.
  type: ShortAnswer
- answer: B
  choices:
    A: The trp repressor falls off the operator, and the operon is highly transcribed.
    B: Tryptophan binds to the trp repressor, helping it bind the operator and block
      transcription.
    C: RNA polymerase binds the operator instead of the promoter and skips transcription.
    D: The trp operon is activated by CAP and cAMP to increase tryptophan production.
  explain: The trp operon is repressible. When tryptophan is abundant, it acts as
    a corepressor by binding the trp repressor protein. This complex binds the operator
    sequence and physically blocks RNA polymerase from transcribing the operon, preventing
    unnecessary synthesis of tryptophan. This explanation elaborates the biological
    principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: In the trp operon of bacteria, what happens when tryptophan levels in the
    cell are high?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: "The trp operon is normally on and is turned off when tryptophan is plentiful,\
    \ because tryptophan activates the trp repressor to block transcription. The lac\
    \ operon is normally off and is turned on only when lactose is present (to inactivate\
    \ the lac repressor) and glucose is low (so cAMP\u2013CAP can recruit RNA polymerase),\
    \ ensuring lactose-use genes are expressed only when lactose is available and\
    \ no better sugar is present."
  explain: "The trp operon is a repressible operon for a biosynthetic pathway: its\
    \ default is to make tryptophan, but high tryptophan feeds back to repress the\
    \ operon. The lac operon is an inducible operon for a catabolic pathway: its default\
    \ is off, and it is induced only when lactose is present as a substrate and glucose\
    \ is scarce, integrating negative regulation by the lac repressor with positive\
    \ regulation by CAP\u2013cAMP. This explanation elaborates the biological principles\
    \ involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step."

    C: Removal of methyl groups from histones and unmethylated promoter DNA
    D: "Addition of a 5' cap and poly-A tail to the gene\u2019s DNA sequence"
  explain: Tightly packed heterochromatin forms when histones are methylated, preventing
    transcription machinery from accessing DNA. Methylation of DNA in promoter regions
    also directly represses transcription. Together, histone methylation and DNA methylation
    are classic epigenetic marks that maintain genes in a silent state. This explanation
    elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms
    and reasoning step by step.
  text: Which combination of chromatin modifications is most likely to keep a gene
    silent in eukaryotic cells?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: Euchromatin is loosely packed chromatin in which DNA is more exposed, allowing
    transcription factors and RNA polymerase to bind promoters and transcribe genes.
    Heterochromatin is tightly packed chromatin where DNA is wrapped and condensed
    around histones, so the transcription machinery cannot access promoters and genes
    in that region are effectively silenced.
  explain: Chromatin structure is a key epigenetic control point. Acetylated histones
    favor an open, euchromatic state with active transcription, while histone methylation
    and other marks create densely packed heterochromatin. In heterochromatin, RNA
    polymerase and general transcription factors physically cannot fit onto the DNA,
    so transcription is strongly reduced or absent. This explanation elaborates the
    biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning
    step by step.

    state affects the ability of RNA polymerase to transcribe nearby genes.
  type: ShortAnswer
- answer: B
  choices:
    A: General transcription factors bind enhancers far from the promoter; specific
      transcription factors bind only the core promoter.
    B: General transcription factors are used by almost all genes to help RNA polymerase
      bind the core promoter; specific transcription factors bind regulatory sequences
      such as enhancers to raise or lower transcription of particular sets of genes.
    C: General transcription factors regulate only one gene each; specific transcription
      factors regulate all genes in the genome equally.
    D: General transcription factors and specific transcription factors are identical
      proteins used in different cell types.
  explain: General transcription factors assemble at the core promoter of most genes
    and are required for RNA polymerase to initiate transcription at all. Specific
    transcription factors bind to regulatory DNA elements such as enhancers or silencers
    outside the core promoter and interact with the general machinery to selectively
    increase or decrease transcription of particular target genes. This explanation
    elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms
    and reasoning step by step.
  text: Which statement correctly distinguishes general transcription factors from
    specific transcription factors in eukaryotic gene regulation?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: A single specific transcription factor can bind the enhancer regions of
    many different target genes that share its recognition sequence. When that transcription
    factor is present in a particular region or time in development, it simultaneously
    alters the transcription of all those genes, coordinating large gene expression
    programs that specify structures like legs versus antennae or different body segments.
  explain: Specific transcription factors recognize particular DNA motifs in enhancers.
    Many developmental genes share these motifs, so when a Hox transcription factor
    is expressed in a segment, it binds multiple enhancers and modulates the activity
    of entire gene networks. This coordinated shift in gene expression patterns drives
    major developmental decisions and patterning. This explanation elaborates the
    biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning
    step by step.

    C: Introns are permanently retained in the mRNA, preventing translation.
    D: "The gene\u2019s DNA sequence is changed whenever splicing occurs."
  explain: Alternative splicing chooses different combinations of exons to keep in
    the mature mRNA. This means a single gene can give rise to several protein isoforms
    that share some domains but differ in others, allowing functional diversity without
    changing the underlying DNA sequence. This explanation elaborates the biological
    principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.

      its degradation or blocking its translation by ribosomes.
    D: They remove the 5' cap and poly-A tail from DNA before transcription.
  explain: "MicroRNAs are short RNAs that are partially complementary to specific\
    \ target mRNAs. When they base pair with those mRNAs, the RNA\u2013protein complex\
    \ can either trigger mRNA degradation or physically prevent ribosomes from translating\

    B: To mark specific proteins for degradation by the proteasome
    C: To splice introns out of pre-mRNA molecules
    D: To phosphorylate cyclin proteins and activate the cell cycle
  explain: Ubiquitin is a small protein that can be covalently attached to other proteins
    as a tag. Chains of ubiquitin on a protein signal proteasomes to bind and degrade
    that protein into amino acids, decreasing its cellular level and thus regulating
    its functional impact. This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved,
    describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: What is the primary role of ubiquitin tagging in post-translational gene regulation?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: "Kinase enzymes can add phosphate groups to specific amino acids on a protein,\
    \ changing its shape or interaction surfaces so that it either becomes active\
    \ or inactive. Phosphatases can later remove those phosphates to reverse the effect.\
    \ By cycling between phosphorylated and dephosphorylated forms, a protein\u2019\
    s activity can be rapidly turned on or off in response to signals."
  explain: Many signaling and cell cycle proteins are regulated post-translationally
    by phosphorylation. Adding negatively charged phosphate groups can cause conformational
    changes or alter binding to partners, thereby switching enzymatic activity, localization,
    or interaction networks. Because phosphorylation is reversible, it provides a
    fast, tunable way to control protein function beyond transcription. This explanation

  choices:
    A: p53 is an enzyme that directly repairs all DNA mutations in the cell.
    B: p53 is a transcription factor that normally activates or represses many genes

      multiple safety checkpoints at once.
    C: p53 is a microRNA that degrades oncogene mRNAs after translation.
    D: p53 is only involved in embryonic development and is not expressed in adult
      cells.
  explain: The lecture notes highlight p53 as a transcription factor whose loss is
    seen in about half of all cancers. Because p53 regulates the expression of many
    genes that halt the cell cycle, promote DNA repair, or trigger cell death after
    damage, inactivating p53 removes several layers of control on cell proliferation,
    greatly increasing the chance that damaged cells grow into tumors. This explanation

- answer: "Cyclin B normally becomes phosphorylated and dephosphorylated in a controlled\
    \ cycle, allowing cells to progress through and then exit specific stages of the\

    B: It is an important enzyme in the glycolysis pathway.
    C: It is one of the 20 amino acids used by all organisms to synthesize proteins.
    D: It is important in inducing sleep.
  explain: Tryptophan is one of the standard 20 amino acids that ribosomes incorporate
    into proteins in every organism. It is not an enzyme in glycolysis and does not
    directly induce the lac operon. Its association with sleep is indirect, via serotonin

    and operator that are transcribed together as one mRNA in prokaryotes. Transcription
    factors and repressors are proteins, and enhancers are eukaryotic regulatory DNA
    elements, not clusters of structural genes. This explanation elaborates the biological

    A: breakdown of glycine
    B: inhibition of bacterial cell division
    C: stoppage of the synthesis of glycine
    D: production of the repressor protein
  explain: This describes a repressible operon for glycine biosynthesis. When glycine
    is plentiful, it acts as a corepressor, activating the repressor so it binds the
    operator and stops transcription of enzymes that make more glycine. It does not
    directly trigger glycine breakdown or stop cell division. This explanation elaborates
    the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning
    step by step.

    is present. They are not permanently on or off. This explanation elaborates the
    biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning
    step by step.'
  text: In general, operons that encode the enzymes of a biosynthetic (anabolic) pathway
    (such as the trp operon) are __________, and those encoding the enzymes of a catabolic
    pathway (such as the lac operon) are __________.
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: B
  choices:
    A: human growth factor
    B: lactose
    C: repressor protein
    D: operator protein
  explain: In the lac operon, lactose (or an analog like IPTG) binds to the lac repressor
    and inactivates it, allowing RNA polymerase to transcribe the operon. If the structural
    genes have been replaced with the human growth factor gene, adding lactose will
    induce expression of that gene. This explanation elaborates the biological principles
    involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: You have inserted the gene for human growth factor into the E. coli lactose
    operon, replacing the structural genes with the gene for human growth factor.
    What substance must you add to your culture of bacteria to cause them to produce
    human growth factor?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: C
  choices:
    A: DNA packing
    B: translation
    C: transcription
    D: post-transcriptional processing
  explain: Operons regulate whether RNA polymerase can initiate transcription of the
    genes. DNA packing is a major eukaryotic mechanism, while translation and post-transcriptional
    processing occur after an mRNA has already been made. This explanation elaborates
    the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning
    step by step.
  text: Both repressible and inducible operons control gene expression at the level
    of __________.
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: A
  choices:
    A: controlling the transcription of genes into mRNA
    B: controlling gene packing and unpacking
    C: controlling the translation of mRNA to produce polypeptides
    D: selectively breaking down the proteins encoded by the genes
  explain: Because bacteria lack complex chromatin structure and need rapid responses,
    they mainly regulate which genes are transcribed into mRNA. Translational control
    and protein degradation exist but are less dominant than transcriptional control.
    This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying
    mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: Gene expression in bacteria is regulated primarily by __________.
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: A
  choices:
    A: in a multicellular eukaryote, different cells are specialized for different
      functions
    B: many genes of eukaryotes provide information for making polypeptides
    C: prokaryotes are restricted to stable environments
    D: eukaryotic cells are much smaller
  explain: Multicellular eukaryotes must generate many distinct cell types from the
    same genome, so they require intricate, layered control of gene expression. Cell
    specialization, not cell size or environmental stability, drives the need for
    additional regulatory mechanisms. This explanation elaborates the biological principles
    involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: The control of gene expression is more complex in multicellular eukaryotes
    than in prokaryotes because __________.
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: C
  choices:
    A: turn certain genes on
    B: form an enhancer
    C: turn off certain genes
    D: form a transcription factor
  explain: DNA methylation and histone deacetylation both promote chromatin condensation,
    making DNA less accessible to transcription machinery. Together they generally
    silence, not activate, genes. Enhancers and transcription factors are distinct
    regulatory elements and proteins. This explanation elaborates the biological principles
    involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: In some cases, DNA methylation and removal of acetyl groups from histones
    (deacetylation) combine to __________.
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: C
  choices:
    A: allowing unpacked genes to be eliminated from the genome
    B: protecting DNA from mutations
    C: controlling access to DNA
    D: enhancing the recombination of genes
  explain: Tightly packed chromatin (heterochromatin) is transcriptionally silent
    because transcription factors and RNA polymerase cannot access the DNA. Loosely
    packed chromatin (euchromatin) is more accessible and active. Packing does not
    normally eliminate genes or increase recombination. This explanation elaborates
    the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning
    step by step.
  text: In eukaryotes, DNA packing seems to affect gene expression primarily by __________.
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: B
  choices:
    A: may involve changes to the rate at which an mRNA is translated
    B: are all of the listed responses
    C: may involve regulation of mRNA splicing
    D: can include changes to mRNA stability
  explain: Post-transcriptional control includes alternative splicing of pre-mRNA,
    regulation of mRNA stability (how long it persists), and modulation of translation
    efficiency. All of the listed mechanisms act after transcription and therefore
    are forms of post-transcriptional regulation. This explanation elaborates the
    biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning
    step by step.
  text: Post-transcriptional controls of gene expression __________.
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: B
  choices:
    A: They are segments of noncoding DNA that help regulate transcription by binding
      certain proteins.
    B: They are giant protein complexes that recognize ubiquitin and degrade the tagged
      proteins.
    C: They encode for products that help prevent uncontrolled cell growth.
    D: They inject double-stranded RNA into a cell, turning off a gene with the same
      sequence.
  explain: Proteasomes are large protein-degrading machines that recognize proteins
    tagged with ubiquitin and break them into peptides. They are not DNA segments,
    genes, or RNA-injecting structures. This explanation elaborates the biological
    principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: What is the role of proteasomes?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: C
  choices:
    A: removal of acetyl groups from histones
    B: DNA methylation
    C: chemical mutation
    D: histone methylation
  explain: Epigenetic changes alter gene expression without changing the underlying
    DNA sequence, commonly through DNA methylation and histone modifications. A chemical
    mutation alters the nucleotide sequence itself, so it is genetic, not epigenetic.
    This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying
    mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: Which of the following statements is NOT associated with epigenetic inheritance?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: D
  choices:
    A: coordinate control of genes on different chromosomes
    B: each gene being activated by a unique combination of control elements and activator
      molecules
    C: the congregation in specific sites in the nucleus of genes involved in related
      metabolic processes, but on different chromosomes
    D: alternate arrangements of exons from a primary transcript
  explain: Alternative RNA splicing allows different combinations of exons to be joined
    from the same primary transcript, producing multiple protein isoforms from one
    gene. The other options describe regulatory phenomena but do not directly increase
    the number of distinct polypeptides. This explanation elaborates the biological
    principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: Although the number of genes in the human genome is surprisingly low compared
    to less complex organisms, the number of possible products from those genes is
    greatly amplified by __________.
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: A
  choices:
    A: promote the degradation of mRNA and bind to complementary mRNA sequences to
      prevent translation
    B: inhibit RNA splicing and bind to complementary DNA sequences to prevent transcription
    C: promote the degradation of mRNA and inhibit RNA splicing
  explain: microRNAs (miRNAs) base-pair with complementary sequences in target mRNAs,
    leading either to mRNA degradation or to blocking of translation. They do not
    typically act at the DNA level or directly inhibit splicing. This explanation
    elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms
    and reasoning step by step.
  text: MicroRNAs function in 'silencing' genes. What are two ways in which they may
    act?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: A
  choices:
    A: does not respond to the chemical signals that control cell division
    B: usually does not contain a nucleus
    C: requires less nutrients than a normal cell
  explain: Cancer cells disregard normal cell-cycle checkpoints and external growth-inhibitory
    signals, so they divide uncontrollably. They still have nuclei and typically consume
    more, not fewer, nutrients than normal cells because of their rapid proliferation.
    This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying
    mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: A cancer cell __________.
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: C
  choices:
    A: DNA ligase
    B: human DNA polymerase
    C: Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase
  explain: PCR requires repeated heating to denature DNA, which would inactivate most
    enzymes. Taq DNA polymerase from Thermus aquaticus is thermostable and can withstand
    these cycles, allowing automated PCR. Human DNA polymerase would denature, and
    ligase is used for sealing nicks, not chain extension. This explanation elaborates
    the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning
    step by step.
  text: Which of the following enzymes is key to the automation of PCR (polymerase
    chain reactions)?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: B
  choices:
    A: synthesize RNA
    B: destroy virus DNA
    C: synthesize protein
  explain: Restriction enzymes recognize specific DNA sequences and cut foreign DNA,
    such as bacteriophage genomes, thereby protecting the bacterium from infection.
    They do not synthesize RNA or protein. This explanation elaborates the biological
    principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: Bacteria use restriction enzymes to __________.
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: B
  choices:
    A: reverse transcriptase
    B: a restriction enzyme
    C: ligase
  explain: Restriction endonucleases recognize short palindromic (symmetrical) DNA
    sequences and cut both strands. Reverse transcriptase copies RNA into DNA, and
    ligase joins DNA fragments rather than cutting them. This explanation elaborates
    the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning
    step by step.
  text: An enzyme that cuts DNA at a symmetrical sequence of bases is called __________.
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: C
  choices:
    A: terminator enzyme
    B: restriction enzyme
    C: DNA ligase
  explain: DNA ligase catalyzes the formation of phosphodiester bonds between adjacent
    nucleotides, sealing nicks in the sugar-phosphate backbone. Restriction enzymes
    cut DNA, and 'terminator enzyme' is not a standard term for this function. This
    explanation elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying
    mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: Which of the following enzymes could seal a nick in one strand of a double-stranded
    DNA molecule by creating a sugar-phosphate bond between the adjacent, unjoined
    nucleotides?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: A
  choices:
    A: a restriction enzyme and a ligase
    B: a restriction enzyme and a polymerase
    C: a polymerase and a topoisomerase
  explain: To make recombinant DNA, a restriction enzyme first cuts the DNA from different
    sources at specific sites. DNA ligase then covalently joins the compatible ends,
    forming stable recombinant molecules. Polymerases and topoisomerases serve different
    roles. This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved, describing
    underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: What two enzymes are needed to produce recombinant DNA?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: A
  choices:
    A: a plasmid or other agent used to transfer DNA into a living cell
    B: a DNA probe used to locate a particular gene
    C: a heat-resistant DNA polymerase
  explain: "A vector is a DNA carrier\u2014such as a plasmid or modified virus\u2014\
    that can enter cells and replicate, delivering foreign DNA. DNA probes are labeled\
    \ fragments used for detection, and heat-resistant polymerase is used in PCR,\
    \ not as a vector. This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved,\
    \ describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step."
  text: In recombinant DNA technology, the term vector refers to __________.
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: C
  choices:
    A: does not involve electrophoresis
    B: can be used to sequence entire eukaryotic chromosomes in a single reaction
    C: produces a ladder of DNA fragments, with each individual band labeled with
      one of four different fluorescent tags
  explain: Sanger sequencing uses dideoxynucleotides that terminate DNA synthesis
    at specific bases, creating fragments of varying lengths. After electrophoresis,
    each fragment ends with a fluorescently labeled base, generating a ladder that
    reveals the sequence. Electrophoresis is essential; entire chromosomes are sequenced
    by assembling many shorter reads. This explanation elaborates the biological principles
    involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: The dideoxyribonucleotide chain-termination method __________.
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: A
  choices:
    A: identify specific DNA sequences
    B: make exact copies of DNA sequences
    C: make DNA from RNA
  explain: A nucleic acid probe is a short, labeled strand of DNA or RNA that base-pairs
    with a complementary sequence in a sample, allowing detection of that specific
    sequence. PCR makes copies of DNA, and reverse transcriptase makes DNA from RNA.
    This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying
    mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: A nucleic acid probe is used to __________.
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: B
  choices:
    A: always matches a stop codon
    B: determines which segment of the genome will be amplified
    C: determines how many cycles of the reaction are needed to obtain a sufficient
      amount of amplified DNA
  explain: PCR primers are short DNA sequences complementary to the ends of the region
    to be amplified. Their base sequences determine where they anneal on the template
    and therefore which segment of the genome will be copied. They are not related
    to stop codons and do not directly set the number of cycles. This explanation
    elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms
    and reasoning step by step.
  text: In the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the sequence of bases in the primers
    is important because it __________.
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: C
  choices:
    A: transfer RNA, matching amino acids, and messenger RNA
    B: ribosomes, matching amino acids, and primers
    C: nucleotides, primers, and polymerase
  explain: After denaturation, PCR requires deoxyribonucleotides, DNA primers complementary
    to the target ends, and a thermostable DNA polymerase. tRNA, amino acids, ribosomes,
    and mRNA are components of translation, not DNA replication. This explanation
    elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms
    and reasoning step by step.
  text: A molecular biologist has isolated a short segment of DNA that she wants to
    replicate by PCR. First she heats the DNA to separate the two strands, and then
    she adds __________.
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: C
  choices:
    A: placing the nucleus from an egg cell into an enucleated somatic cell
    B: the use of microarray analysis and RNA interference
    C: removing the nucleus of an egg cell and replacing it with the nucleus of a
      somatic cell
  explain: In reproductive cloning, the nucleus is removed from an unfertilized egg
    and replaced with the nucleus from a differentiated somatic cell. The reconstructed
    egg is then stimulated to divide, producing a clone of the donor. Microarrays
    and RNA interference are analytical and regulatory tools, not the core cloning
    step. This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved, describing
    underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: Nuclear transplantation for reproductive cloning involves __________.
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: C
  choices:
    A: gain and lose genes, depending on what type of cell they will become
    B: exchange DNA with other cells via the process of horizontal gene transfer
    C: express different genes in response to developmental signals
  explain: Most animal cells retain essentially the same genome; differentiation occurs
    because different sets of genes are turned on or off in response to signals. Cells
    generally do not lose large sets of genes or horizontally exchange DNA during
    normal development. This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved,
    describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: During the process of differentiation, cells __________.
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: A
  choices:
    A: a particular nucleotide sequence at a particular gene whose inheritance can
      be followed
    B: a chart that traces the family history of a genetic trait
    C: a radioactive probe used to find a gene
  explain: A genetic marker is a known DNA sequence (such as a SNP or short repeat)
    at a locus that can be tracked through pedigrees or populations. A pedigree chart
    is a diagram of inheritance patterns, and a probe is a labeled nucleic acid used
    for detection, not the marker itself. This explanation elaborates the biological
    principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: A genetic marker is __________.
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: B
  choices:
    A: allowing individuals to follow the natural progression of a genetic disorder,
      accompanied by counseling, then drug treatment when the condition becomes life-threatening
    B: adding a functioning version of a defective gene to the cells of an individual
    C: replacing organs affected with genetic disorders by transplants
  explain: Gene therapy attempts to treat disease by introducing a normal, functional
    copy of a gene into a patient's cells, typically using a viral or other vector.
    It is distinct from symptomatic management or organ transplantation. This explanation
    elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms
    and reasoning step by step.
  text: Gene therapy involves __________.
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: B
  choices:
    A: a bacterium that has been treated with a compound that affects the expression
      of many of its genes
    B: a rat with rabbit hemoglobin genes
    C: a fern grown in cell culture from a single fern root cell
  explain: "A transgenic organism carries foreign DNA\u2014such as a rat engineered\
    \ to contain and express rabbit hemoglobin genes. Treating a bacterium with a\
    \ compound that changes gene expression does not alter its genome, and a fern\
    \ grown from its own cells is genetically identical to the parent. This explanation\
    \ elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms\
    \ and reasoning step by step."
  text: Which of the following would be considered a transgenic or genetically modified
    organism?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: A
  choices:
    A: heterochromatin
    B: euchromatin
  explain: Inactivated X chromosomes in female mammals become highly condensed and
    transcriptionally silent. This tightly packed state is called heterochromatin,
    whereas euchromatin is less condensed and actively transcribed. This explanation
    elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms
    and reasoning step by step.
  text: In females one of the X chromosomes is inactivated and doesn't express genes.
    This inactivated chromosome is _______________.
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: The trp operon is normally on because tryptophan is an essential amino acid
    that the cell must synthesize unless it is abundant; when tryptophan levels are
    high, tryptophan activates the repressor to shut the operon off. The lac operon
    is normally off because lactose is not always present, so it is wasteful to make
    lactose-digesting enzymes; it is only turned on when lactose is available and
    is the preferred sugar.
  explain: 'The trp operon is a repressible operon: its default state is active so
    the cell can continuously produce enzymes for tryptophan synthesis, and excess
    tryptophan acts as a corepressor to shut the system down. The lac operon is an
    inducible operon: its default state is off to conserve energy, and the presence
    of lactose (via allolactose) induces expression only when the sugar is available.
    This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying
    mechanisms and reasoning step by step.'
  text: In E. coli the trp operon is on by default, while the lac operon is off. Why
    is this the case?
  type: ShortAnswer
- answer: To conserve energy/resources and to respond appropriately to changes in
    internal or external environmental conditions.
  explain: Making proteins is energetically expensive, so cells regulate gene expression
    to avoid producing proteins they do not currently need. Regulation also lets cells
    adjust gene expression in response to environmental signals (nutrient availability,
    stress, signals from other cells) so they can adapt and survive. This explanation
    elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms
    and reasoning step by step.
  text: What are two major reasons organisms regulate gene expression?
  type: ShortAnswer
- answer: B
  choices:
    A: mRNA processing
    B: Transcription
    C: Chromatin structure
    D: Translation
  explain: Bacteria lack a nucleus and have little or no mRNA processing and chromatin
    remodeling, so controlling whether transcription starts at promoters is the primary
    way they regulate which genes are expressed. This explanation elaborates the biological
    principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: At what level does most bacterial gene regulation occur?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: A
  choices:
    A: Transcription will start
    B: Transcription will stop
  explain: A repressor bound to the operator blocks RNA polymerase from transcribing
    the structural genes. Removing the repressor frees the operator so RNA polymerase
    can move through the operon and initiate transcription. This explanation elaborates
    the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning
    step by step.
  text: What will happen when you remove a transcriptional repressor from an operon
    it normally controls?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: A
  choices:
    A: Operator
    B: Structural gene
    C: Promoter
    D: Transcription factor binding sites
  explain: The operator is the regulatory DNA sequence within or near the promoter
    where the repressor binds. Binding of the repressor to the operator physically
    blocks RNA polymerase; promoters and structural genes have different functions.
    This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying
    mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: Repressor proteins in bacterial operons bind to which specific DNA sequence?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: B
  choices:
    A: RNA polymerase
    B: tryptophan
    C: glucose
    D: lactose
  explain: When tryptophan levels are high, tryptophan binds to the inactive trp repressor,
    changing its shape so it can bind the operator and shut down transcription. Glucose
    and lactose regulate other systems (e.g., lac operon) rather than the trp operon.
    This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying
    mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: What molecule acts as the corepressor that causes the repressor to bind to
    the trp operon?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: The lac operon uses allolactose, a derivative of lactose, as an inducer.
    When lactose is absent, no allolactose is made, so the lac repressor remains bound
    to the operator and blocks transcription. When lactose is present, some is converted
    to allolactose, which binds the repressor and causes it to release the operator,
    allowing RNA polymerase to transcribe the lac genes.
  explain: Allolactose is produced only when lactose is available in the cell. It
    binds to the lac repressor and changes its conformation so it can no longer bind
    the operator. Without allolactose (no lactose present), the repressor stays on
    the operator and keeps the operon off; with allolactose, the repressor falls off
    and the operon is induced. This explanation elaborates the biological principles
    involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: How does the lac operon sense the presence or absence of lactose? Explain
    what happens when lactose is absent and when it is present.
  type: ShortAnswer
- answer: "The lac operon uses cAMP and the catabolite activator protein (CAP) to\
    \ monitor glucose. When glucose is low or absent, cAMP levels rise; cAMP binds\
    \ CAP, and the cAMP\u2013CAP complex binds near the lac promoter to increase RNA\
    \ polymerase binding and strongly activate transcription (if lactose is also present).\
    \ When glucose is abundant, cAMP levels are low, so CAP does not bind DNA and\
    \ transcription of the lac operon is greatly reduced."
  explain: "Glucose availability inversely controls cAMP concentration. High cAMP\
    \ under low-glucose conditions allows the cAMP\u2013CAP complex to bind the promoter\
    \ and recruit RNA polymerase, maximizing expression of lactose-utilization genes\
    \ when glucose is scarce. When glucose is present, cAMP drops, CAP cannot bind,\
    \ and even if lactose is present the operon is only weakly expressed. This explanation\
    \ elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms\
    \ and reasoning step by step."

- answer: Epigenetics is the study of heritable changes in gene expression or phenotype
    that occur without changes to the underlying DNA sequence.
  explain: Epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone modifications, and
    chromatin remodeling can be passed through cell division and alter how genes are
    expressed, but they do not alter the nucleotide sequence itself. This explanation
    elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms
    and reasoning step by step.

- answer: D
  choices:
    A: Acetyl
    B: Phosphate
    C: Ubiquitin
    D: Methyl
  explain: Histone methylation, especially at particular lysine residues, is associated
    with tightly packed heterochromatin and reduced gene expression. Histone acetylation
    usually correlates with open chromatin and active transcription. This explanation
    elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms
    and reasoning step by step.

    with forming heterochromatin and gene silencing?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: D
  choices:
    A: General transcription factors
    B: Promoters
    C: Terminators
    D: Specific transcription factors (activators or repressors)
  explain: Enhancers are regulatory DNA elements bound by specific transcription factors
    that either activate or repress transcription of target genes. General transcription
    factors bind the core promoter and are required for transcription of many genes,
    not just specific ones. This explanation elaborates the biological principles
    involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: Which molecules bind to enhancer sequences to control expression of specific
    genes in eukaryotes?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: A
  choices:
    A: Repressed
    B: Mutated
    C: Activated, but only partially
    D: Fully activated
  explain: Without lactose, the lac repressor remains bound to the operator, keeping
    the operon off, even though low glucose would raise cAMP and activate CAP. Because
    the repressor is still blocking transcription, the operon is repressed. This explanation
    elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms
    and reasoning step by step.
  text: If glucose is absent and lactose is also absent, what is the state of the
    lac operon?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: D
  choices:
    A: promoter
    B: operator
    C: repressor
    D: activator
  explain: When bound to arabinose, AraC stimulates transcription of the ara operon
    by helping RNA polymerase bind; in this context it functions as an activator rather
    than a repressor or a DNA sequence like a promoter or operator. This explanation
    elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms
    and reasoning step by step.
  text: The ara operon is an inducible operon that controls the breakdown of arabinose.
    When arabinose is present, it binds to the protein AraC, and the complex binds
    to the initiator site to promote transcription. In this scenario, AraC is acting
    as a(n) ________.

- answer: miRNAs can base-pair with target mRNAs to trigger their degradation and/or
    to block their translation by ribosomes.
  explain: "miRNA\u2013RISC complexes recognize complementary mRNA sequences. Depending\
    \ on the degree of complementarity, the complex either cleaves the mRNA (leading\
    \ to degradation) or prevents ribosomes from efficiently translating it, thereby\
    \ lowering protein production. This explanation elaborates the biological principles\
    \ involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step."

- answer: B
  choices:
    A: Protein activation
    B: Protein degradation
    C: Protein translation
    D: Activation of transcription
  explain: Ubiquitin tags proteins for destruction by the proteasome. Polyubiquitinated
    proteins are recognized, unfolded, and degraded into peptides, effectively reducing

  text: Adding ubiquitin molecules to a protein typically targets it for which outcome?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: Cancer often involves abnormal gene expression, such as overexpression or
    activation of oncogenes and loss or reduced expression of tumor suppressor genes.
  explain: Mutations, epigenetic changes, or regulatory defects can activate growth-promoting
    genes (oncogenes) or silence growth-inhibiting genes (tumor suppressors). This
    imbalance in gene expression drives uncontrolled cell division and other hallmarks
    of cancer. This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved, describing
    underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.

- answer: D
  choices:
    A: operator
    B: nucleosome
    C: splicing component
    D: transcription factor
  explain: p53 is a transcription factor that binds specific DNA sequences and regulates
    many genes involved in cell-cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Its loss
    or mutation disrupts these protective gene-expression programs. This explanation
    elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms
    and reasoning step by step.
  text: p53 is an important tumor suppressor. It strongly influences gene expression
    because it functions as a ________.
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: D
  choices:
    A: chromatids
    B: ribosomes
    C: capsids
    D: histones
  explain: Histones are positively charged proteins that form nucleosomes, the core
    units of chromatin. DNA wraps around histone octamers, helping compact the DNA
    within the nucleus. This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved,
    describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: DNA in eukaryotic chromosomes is wound around proteins called ____________.
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: Eukaryotic transcription requires many specialized transcription factors
    and occurs in the nucleus with extensive RNA processing (including intron splicing),
    whereas prokaryotic transcription uses fewer factors, occurs in the cytoplasm,
    and mRNAs are typically not spliced.
  explain: In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase II needs a large set of general and specific
    transcription factors, and the primary transcript is heavily processed (5' cap,
    splicing, 3' poly-A tail). In bacteria, a single RNA polymerase with sigma factors
    initiates transcription, and the resulting mRNA can be translated immediately,
    with no introns to remove. This explanation elaborates the biological principles
    involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: What are two key differences in transcription between prokaryotes and eukaryotes?
  type: ShortAnswer
- answer: The longer an mRNA persists without being degraded, the more protein can
    be translated from it; short-lived mRNAs produce less protein, so mRNA stability
    directly influences the level of gene expression.
  explain: mRNA degradation is a key post-transcriptional control point. Stable mRNAs
    can be translated many times, amplifying gene expression, whereas unstable mRNAs
    are rapidly degraded, limiting how much protein is made even if transcription
    occurred. This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved, describing
    underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.

    expression?

- answer: C
  choices:
    A: Adding a lysis buffer containing detergent to break open cell membranes
    B: Treating the sample with proteases and RNases to remove proteins and RNA
    C: Adding cold alcohol on top of the aqueous cell lysate
    D: "Heating the sample to 95\xB0C to denature the DNA"
  explain: "Lysis buffer with detergent breaks membranes and releases DNA, but the\
    \ DNA stays dissolved in water. When cold alcohol is added, DNA\u2014which is\
    \ insoluble in alcohol\u2014precipitates out as a solid, forming the visible strands\
    \ at the interface. This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved,\
    \ describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step."
  text: In the DNA extraction procedure shown in lecture, what step actually makes
    the dissolved DNA come out of solution as visible, stringy material?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: The lysis buffer with detergent dissolves and disrupts cell and nuclear
    membranes, releasing DNA into solution so it can later be precipitated.
  explain: Cell and nuclear membranes are lipid bilayers. Detergents in the lysis
    buffer solubilize these lipids, breaking open cells and freeing DNA into the aqueous
    phase. Without first lysing the cells, most DNA would remain trapped inside intact
    cells and would not be available to precipitate when alcohol is added. This explanation
    elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms
    and reasoning step by step.
  text: During DNA extraction, what is the main role of the lysis buffer that contains
    detergent, and why is this step necessary before adding alcohol?
  type: ShortAnswer
- answer: B
  choices:
    A: Any random sequence as long as it is at least 20 base pairs long
    B: "Short palindromic sequences that read the same 5'\u21923' on both strands"
    C: Only promoter regions upstream of genes
    D: "Only intron\u2013exon boundaries in eukaryotic genes"
  explain: As shown in the restriction enzyme figure, enzymes like EcoRI recognize
    short, specific palindromic sequences (e.g., GAATTC/CTTAAG). They cut at or near
    these recognition sites to generate reproducible fragments for cloning or analysis.
    This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying
    mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: Restriction endonucleases used in biotechnology typically recognize what kind
    of DNA sequence?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: Recombinant DNA is a DNA molecule that contains sequences from two or more
    different sources; a plasmid vector is the circular DNA molecule into which the
    foreign DNA fragment is inserted so it can be carried and replicated in a host
    cell.
  explain: "In lecture, recombinant DNA was described as a DNA molecule built from\
    \ sequences originating in different organisms. Plasmids serve as vectors\u2014\
    small circular DNA molecules that naturally replicate in bacteria. By cutting\
    \ both the plasmid and the DNA of interest with compatible restriction enzymes\
    \ and sealing them with DNA ligase, the foreign insert is carried and copied each\
    \ time the plasmid replicates. This explanation elaborates the biological principles\
    \ involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step."
  text: Define recombinant DNA and explain the role of a plasmid vector in creating
    recombinant DNA molecules.
  type: ShortAnswer
- answer: false
  explain: Sticky ends are created when restriction endonucleases cut DNA at specific
    palindromic sites. DNA ligase does not cut; instead, it catalyzes the formation
    of phosphodiester bonds that seal nicks between compatible ends, permanently joining
    plasmid and insert DNA into a recombinant molecule. This explanation elaborates
    the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning
    step by step.
  text: DNA ligase is used in cloning to generate sticky ends on DNA fragments so
    that they can insert into plasmid vectors.
  type: TrueFalse
- answer: B
  choices:
    A: The largest DNA fragments, because they have the most negative charge
    B: The smallest DNA fragments, because they move more easily through the gel matrix
    C: All fragments move the same distance because they have the same charge-to-mass
      ratio
    D: Only circular plasmid DNA, because linear fragments cannot move in the gel
  explain: An agarose gel acts like a molecular sieve. All DNA fragments are negatively
    charged, but smaller fragments experience less resistance moving through the pores
    and therefore migrate farther from the wells toward the positive electrode in
    a given amount of time. This explanation elaborates the biological principles
    involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: In the gel electrophoresis diagrams from lecture, which DNA fragments travel
    farthest from the wells toward the positive electrode?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: DNA from each potential parent and the child is cut with the same restriction
    enzyme and run on a gel; the true biological parent will share a characteristic
    pattern of fragment bands with the child that the unrelated adult will not.
  explain: "In the paternity example, restriction enzymes generated fragment patterns\
    \ that reflected the underlying DNA sequence. When run side-by-side on a gel,\
    \ bands from the child matched bands from one parent for each chromosome set.\
    \ The alleged parent whose banding pattern best matches the child\u2019s at multiple\
    \ fragments is inferred to be the biological parent. This explanation elaborates\
    \ the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning\
    \ step by step."

  explain: Lecture distinguished molecular cloning from reproductive cloning. Molecular
    cloning means making many identical copies of a specific DNA sequence (often in
    bacteria using plasmids). Reproductive cloning uses nuclear transfer to generate
    a whole new organism genetically identical to the donor, as in Dolly the sheep.
    This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying
    mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: Molecular cloning refers to making a genetically identical copy of an entire
    organism, such as Dolly the sheep.
  type: TrueFalse
- answer: B
  choices:
    A: Molecular cloning copies entire chromosomes, whereas reproductive cloning copies
      only plasmids.
    B: Molecular cloning copies DNA sequences in microbes; reproductive cloning uses
      a donor nucleus to make a whole multicellular organism.
    C: Molecular cloning requires a surrogate mother, while reproductive cloning does
      not.
    D: They are the same process, just in different species.
  explain: Molecular cloning focuses on inserting a DNA fragment into a vector and
    amplifying it in bacteria, creating cloned DNA molecules. Reproductive cloning
    transfers a nucleus from a somatic cell into an enucleated egg and implants the
    embryo into a surrogate so that an entire organism genetically matching the donor
    develops. This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved, describing
    underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: Which statement best contrasts molecular cloning with reproductive cloning?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: B
  choices:
    A: They already function as specialized heart or liver cells.
    B: They can become any cell type in the human body (are pluripotent).
    C: They only divide a few times and then stop, reducing cancer risk.
    D: They lack DNA and therefore cannot mutate.
  explain: The slides emphasized that human embryonic stem cells are undifferentiated
    and can become any type of cell in the human body. This pluripotency makes them
    powerful for studying disease mechanisms and, in principle, for growing replacement
    tissues or organs. This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved,
    describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.

  explain: "In PCR, heating to about 95\xB0C denatures the double helix into single\
    \ strands. Cooling to around 55\xB0C allows short primers to anneal to their complementary\
    \ sites. Heating to about 72\xB0C, the optimum for Taq polymerase, lets the enzyme\
    \ extend from the primers and synthesize new DNA strands. This explanation elaborates\
    \ the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning\
    \ step by step."
  options:
    A: "DNA polymerase synthesizes new DNA from the primers\u2019 3\u2032 ends."
    B: Primers base-pair with their complementary target sequences.
    C: Double-stranded DNA is melted into single strands.

- answer: C
  choices:
    A: It can recognize any DNA sequence without primers.
    B: It requires no nucleotides (dNTPs) to synthesize DNA.
    C: It is stable and active at the high temperatures used to repeatedly denature
      DNA.
    D: It only copies RNA, which is necessary for PCR.
  explain: "Thermus aquaticus is a thermophilic bacterium from hot springs such as\
    \ those in Yellowstone. Its DNA polymerase (Taq) evolved to function at high temperatures,\
    \ so it remains stable through repeated heating to ~95\xB0C in PCR, avoiding the\
    \ need to add fresh enzyme after every cycle. This explanation elaborates the\
    \ biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning\
    \ step by step."
  text: Why is Taq polymerase from Thermus aquaticus specifically used in PCR instead
    of ordinary DNA polymerases?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: false
  explain: "The principle of PCR diagnostics is that primers only amplify their matching\
    \ target. If a band appears after PCR with SARS-CoV-2\u2013specific primers, it\
    \ means viral genetic material was present and served as a template. Lack of amplification\
    \ suggests no detectable virus in the sample. This explanation elaborates the\
    \ biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning\
    \ step by step."

  explain: Lecture distinguished genetic mapping, which uses recombination frequencies
    and markers to place genes in order, from physical mapping, which pinpoints the
    actual chromosomal positions. Genetic markers are the short DNA sequences whose
    inheritance is tracked to infer linkage to genes. This explanation elaborates
    the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning
    step by step.
  options:
    A: A known DNA sequence used to track linkage with a gene of interest

    B: A radioactive amino acid that labels proteins translated from the gene
    C: A restriction enzyme that cuts the gene out of the chromosome
    D: A fluorescent lipid that inserts into the nuclear membrane
  explain: "FISH employs single-stranded DNA probes that are complementary to the\
    \ target gene and tagged with a fluorescent dye. These probes hybridize to their\
    \ matching sequence on chromosomes, which then glow under a fluorescence microscope,\
    \ revealing the gene\u2019s physical location. This explanation elaborates the\

- answer: A contig is a longer, continuous DNA sequence assembled by overlapping many
    short individual sequencing reads that share matching sequence at their ends.
  explain: "Classic Sanger sequencing reads about 1000 bases at a time. For large\
    \ genomes, fragments are sequenced separately and then computationally aligned\
    \ wherever their sequences overlap. These overlaps allow the short reads to be\
    \ stitched into contiguous sequences\u2014contigs\u2014that represent larger stretches\
    \ of the genome. This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved,\
    \ describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step."
  text: In whole-genome sequencing projects, what is a "contig" and how is it produced
    from many short Sanger sequencing reads?
  type: ShortAnswer
- answer: C
  choices:
    A: It cannot sequence more than a single gene at a time.
    B: It always misses coding regions and only sequences introns.
    C: Short reads from highly repetitive DNA make it hard to place fragments uniquely
      in the genome.
    D: It requires cloning every fragment into bacteria before sequencing.
  explain: Shotgun sequencing randomly breaks the genome into many small pieces and
    sequences them. When large portions of the genome consist of repeated sequences,
    many reads look nearly identical and can fit in multiple places, creating ambiguous
    branches during assembly and making it difficult to reconstruct a unique genome
    sequence. This explanation elaborates the biological principles involved, describing
    underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.
  text: According to the lecture, what major challenge does shotgun sequencing encounter
    when assembling large genomes like the human genome?
  type: MultiChoice
- answer: true
  explain: The slides noted that older Sanger-based approaches made the Human Genome
    Project extremely expensive, but modern high-throughput NGS technologies can generate
    billions of ~100-base reads in a single run, dropping the cost of a full human
    genome to roughly $1000. This explanation elaborates the biological principles
    involved, describing underlying mechanisms and reasoning step by step.

    a human genome from billions of dollars to around a thousand dollars by producing
    massive numbers of short reads in parallel.
  type: TrueFalse
- answer: B
  choices:
    A: The genome is all the RNA in a cell; the proteome is all the DNA.
    B: The genome is all of the DNA in a cell; the proteome is all of the proteins
      present in that cell.
    C: The genome changes dramatically from cell type to cell type; the proteome is
      identical in every tissue.
    D: Only the proteome can be used to study cancer.
  explain: Chapter 17.5 defined the genome as the complete set of DNA in a cell and
    the proteome as the complete set of proteins. While virtually all cells in an
    individual share the same genome, different cell types express different subsets
    of genes and protein modifications, giving each a distinct proteome. This explanation
    elaborates the biological principles involved, describing underlying mechanisms
    and reasoning step by step.

- answer: Mass spectrometry directly identifies and quantifies the proteins present
    (and often their modifications), revealing which proteins cancer cells actually
    make, which cannot be fully predicted from mRNA levels alone.
  explain: "The lecture emphasized that not all RNAs become protein and many proteins\
    \ are chemically modified after translation. Mass spectrometry\u2013based proteomics\
    \ allows researchers to catalogue the actual protein composition and modifications\
    \ in cancer versus normal cells, helping to identify protein signatures that might\
